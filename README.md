# LagChunkProtector

ChunkFreeze is a lightweight Minecraft (Bukkit/Spigot/Paper) plugin that automatically detects and freezes laggy chunks in real-time. It helps protect your server from redstone lag machines and other chunk-based performance issues by monitoring block physics, redstone activity, fluid updates, and more.

# Features

- Automatically tracks chunk update lag via nanosecond timing

- Freezes chunks that exceed a configurable lag threshold (default: 900ms)

- Cancels redstone updates, fluid movements, block growth, and physics in frozen chunks

- Reduces the impact of lag machines and abusive redstone contraptions

- Works silently in the background with no player commands required

# Idea For

Survival and anarchy servers

Protecting against redstone lag machines (like on 2b2t)

Reducing TPS drops from overloaded chunks
